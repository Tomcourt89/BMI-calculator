                <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
                <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.</p>
